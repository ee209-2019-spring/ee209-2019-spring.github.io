<h2> Lectures and Precepts </h2>
<hr>

<p>
Lecture attendance is mandatory. You are responsible for
the materials presented in the lecture and precepts. Some of the
content is not in the textbook.

Students are expected to regularly check
the <a href="./index.html">course
webpage</a>
for <a href="./announcements.shtml">announcements</a>, <a href="./syllabus.shtml">class
schedule updates</a>, lecture
notes, <a href="./assignments.shtml">programming assignments</a> and
other related course materials.
</p>

<!--h3> Attending another precept <i>instead of</i> your precept: </h3>

Generally it is not acceptable to attend another precept instead of
your precept. After all, your preceptor will determine your <b>class
participation grade</b>. Your grade will be poor if you do not
participate in your precept. However, it is acceptable to attend
another precept instead of your precept occasionally whenever a
conflict with your precept arises. (Indeed you should do so.) In that
case, as soon at you become aware of the conflict, send e-mail to your
preceptor, the other preceptor, and Dr. Park informing them of the
situation. The other preceptor thus will know to duplicate handouts
for you.

<p>
<h3> Attending another precept <i>in addition to</i> your precept: </h3>

Generally it is not acceptable to attend another precept in addition
to your precept. After all, if even a small fraction of the course's
students did that routinely, then some precepts would be very large
(or even overflow) routinely. Precepts containing a large number of
students are less effective than those containing a small
number. However, it could be acceptable to attend another precept in
addition to your own occasionally. In that case, send e-mail to the
other preceptor and Dr. Park the day before the precept, asking
permission to attend. The other preceptor and Dr. Park then will make
the decision. If the decision is "yes," then the other preceptor will
duplicate handouts for you, make sure you have a seat, etc.

(Acknowledgment: many sentences from below are borrowed
from <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring10/cos217/">Princeton
COS 217 homepage</a> since they apply to our course as well.)

<h3> Receiving help from others </h3>

Programming is an individual creative process much like
composition. You must reach your own understanding of the problem and
discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with
other people are permitted and encouraged. However, when the time
comes to write code that solves the problem, such discussions (except
with course staff members) are no longer appropriate: the code must be
your own work. If you have a question about how to use some feature of
C, Unix, etc., you certainly can ask your friends or the teaching
assistants, but specific questions about code you have written must be
treated more carefully.

<p>
For each assignment you must specifically state, in your readme file,
the names of any individuals from whom you received help, and the
nature of the help that you received. That includes help from friends,
classmates, lab TAs, course staff members, etc.

</p><p>
Do not, <i>under any circumstances</i>, copy another person's
code. Incorporating someone else's code into your code in any form is
a violation of academic regulations. This includes adapting solutions
or partial solutions to assignments from any offering of this course
or any other course. There is one exception to the code-sharing rule:
You may adapt code from the EE 209 course materials provided that you
explain what code you use, and cite its source in your readme file.

</p><p>
Copying and transforming someone else's code (by rearranging
independent code, renaming variables, rewording comments, etc.) is
<b>plagiarism</b>. Some inexperienced programmers have the
misconception that detecting such plagiarism is difficult. Actually,
detecting such plagiarism is quite easy. Not only does such plagiarism
quickly identify itself during the grading process, but also we can
(and do) use software packages, such as Alex Aiken's renowned MOSS
software, for automated help.

</p><p>
If a student is confirmed to commit plagiarism on an assignment, then
the standard penalty is <b>automatic failure (F)</b> of the EE 209
course.

</p><h3> Providing help to others </h3>
<p>
Abetting plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration by "sharing" your
code is prohibited. Sharing code in digital form is an especially
egregious violation. Do not e-mail your code or make your code
available to anyone. Do not share your code with anyone even after the
due date/time of the assignment.

</p><p>
You are responsible for keeping your solutions to the EE 209
programming assignments away from prying eyes. If someone else copies
your code, we have no way to determine who is the owner and who is the
copier. If you are working on a public lab computer, make sure
that you do not leave the computer unattended, and that you delete
your local files and logout before leaving.

You should store all of your assignment files in a private
directory. You can create a private directory using commands similar
to these:

</p><p>
</p><pre>% mkdir ee209
% chmod 700 ee209
</pre>


<h3> Exam Conduct</h3>

If we find a student commits inappropriate conduct during an in-class exam, the standard penalty is <b>automatic failure (F)</b> of the EE 209 course.
