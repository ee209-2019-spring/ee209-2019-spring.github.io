EE 209: Programming Structures for EE</h1>

<h2>Assignment 3: Customer Management Table</h2>

</center>

<hr>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you learn how to
implement common data structures in C and how to exploit them to
achieve modularity in a real-world application. It also will give you
the opportunity to gain more experience with the GNU/Linux programming
tools, especially <code>bash</code>,
<code>emacs</code>, and <code>gdb</code>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p> Dynamic resizing of an array in task 1 is "on your own" part of
this assignment. This part is worth 15% of this assignment.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>A data structure is a way of organizing data for efficient
operation. In this assignment, you will implement the required
functionalities (register, unregister, and find) of a customer
management program using the following data structures.

</p><ul>
<li>Array: an array is a collection of the same data type, where
its elements are stored linearly in memory. </li>

<li>Hash table: a more efficient implementation might use a <em>hash
table</em>, which reduces the complexity to search for data. Hash
tables are described
in Lecture
10</a> of this course, or Section 2.9 of <em>The Practice of
Programming</em> (Kernighan &amp; Pike) and Chapter 14
of <em>Algorithms in C, Parts 1-4</em> (Sedgewick).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Your Task</h3>

<p>You will implement and improve the customer data management API
using various data structures. Your task in this assignment is
threefold: </p>

<ul>
<li>[Task 1] Implement an API library for the customer data
management, using a dynamcailly resizable array.</li>

<li>[Task 2] Implement the same API library using a hash table. </li>

<li>[Task 3] Test the correctness of your two libraries and measure
the performance.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>The <code>customer_manager</code> Interface</h3>
<code>customer_manager</code> is an API library for the customer data management, where the users can register the customer information and perform lookup operations to retrieve the purchase amount information.

<p>The <code>customer_manager</code> interface introduces a structure type definition, <code>DB_T</code>:
</p><ul>
<li>Conceptually, the <code>DB_T</code> structure is used for saving
the pointer(s) to the entire customer data.</li>
<ul>
<li>The per-customer data includes the customer name, ID, and purchase amount. <!-- (as defined in <a href="http://www.ndsl.kaist.edu/~kyoungsoo/ee209/assignment/cr/index.html#customer">Assignment 1</a>)--></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The <code>customer_manager</code> interface is described in a file named <a href="skeleton/customer_manager.h"><code>customer_manager.h</code></a>, and it contains these function declarations:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:2em; color: blue;">DB_T CreateCustomerDB(void);</pre>
<pre style="margin-left:2em; color: blue;">void DestroyCustomerDB(DB_T d);</pre>
<pre style="margin-left:2em; color: blue;">int RegisterCustomer(DB_T d, const char *id, const char *name, const int purchase);</pre>
<pre style="margin-left:2em; color: blue;">int UnregisterCustomerByID(DB_T d, const char *id);</pre>
<pre style="margin-left:2em; color: blue;">int UnregisterCustomerByName(DB_T d, const char *name);</pre>
<pre style="margin-left:2em; color: blue;">int GetPurchaseByID(DB_T d, const char *id);</pre>
<pre style="margin-left:2em; color: blue;">int GetPurchaseByName(DB_T d, const char *name);</pre>
<pre style="margin-left:2em; color: blue;">typedef int (*FUNCPTR_T)(const char* id, const char* name, const int purchase);</pre>
<pre style="margin-left:2em; color: blue;">int GetSumCustomerPurchase(DB_T d, FUNCPTR_T fp);</pre>

<p>What each function does is as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>CreateCustomerDB</code> should allocate memory for a new <code>DB_T</code> object and any underlying objects.</li>
<ul>
<li>On success, it should return a pointer to the memory block for the new <code>DB_T</code> object.</li>
<li>If the function fails to allocate the memory, it should return <code>NULL</code>.</li>
</ul>

<li><code>DestroyCustomerDB</code> should free all memory occupied by the <code>DB_T</code> object and all the underlying objects.</li>
<ul>
<li>If the given pointer to the <code>DB_T</code> object is <code>NULL</code>, it should do nothing.</li>
</ul>

<li><code>RegisterCustomer</code> registers a new item, that is, a new
user whose ID is <code>id</code>, name is <code>name</code>, and
purchase amount is <code>purchase</code> to the <code>DB_T</code>
object <code>d</code>.
<ul>

<li>This function should store a new user item with her customer information with <code>d</code>. </li>
<li>The new item should _own_ the id and name strings by copying them to new buffers. Consider using <code>strdup()</code>. If you use <code>strdup()</code>, please add <code>-D_GNU_SOURCE</code> after <code>gcc209</code>. (e.g., <code>$ gcc209 -D_GNU_SOURCE -o testclient testclient.c</code>)</li>
<li>On success, it should return 0. Otherwise (e.g., on failure), it should return -1. </li>
<li>If any of <code>d</code>, <code>id</code>, or <code>name</code> is <code>NULL</code>, it is a failure. If <code>purchase</code> is zero or a negative number, it is a failure.</li>
<li>If an item with the same id _or_ with the same name already exists, it is a failure. You should not modify the existing item in this case,
and should not leak memory for the new item. A good strategy is to check if such an item already exists, and allocate the new item only
if it does not exist. </li>
</ul>

</li><li><code>UnregisterCustomerByID</code> unregisters a user whose ID is <code>id</code> from the <code>DB_T</code> object, <code>d</code>.</li>
<ul>
<li>On success, it should return 0. Otherwise, it should return -1. </li>
<li>If <code>d</code> or <code>id</code> is <code>NULL</code>, it is a failure. If no such item exists, it is a failure.</li>
<li>Make sure that you free all the memory allocated for the item being unregistered.</li>
</ul>

<li><code>UnregisterCustomerByName</code> unregisters a user whose name is <code>name</code> from the <code>DB_T</code> object, <code>d</code>.</li>
<ul>
<li> It is identical to <code>UnregisterCustomerByID</code> except that it matches <code>name</code> instead of <code>id</code>.
</li><li>On success, it should return 0. Otherwise, it should return -1. </li>
<li>If <code>d</code> or <code>name</code> is <code>NULL</code>, it is a failure. If no such item exists, it is a failure.</li>
<li>Make sure that you free all the memory allocated for the item being unregistered.</li>
</ul>

<li><code>GetPurchaseByID</code> searches for the purchase amount of the customer whose ID is <code>id</code> from a <code>DB_T</code> object <code>d</code>.</li>
<ul>
<li>On success, it should return the purchase amount. Otherwise, it should return -1</li>
<li>If <code>d</code> or <code>id</code> is <code>NULL</code>, it is a failure. If there is no customer whose ID matches the given one, it is a failure.</li></ul>

<li><code>GetPurchaseByName</code> searches for the purchase amount of the customer whose name is <code>name</code> from a <code>DB_T</code> object <code>d</code>.</li>
<ul>
<li>It is identical to <code>GetPurchaseByID</code> except that it matches <code>name</code> instead of <code>id</code>.
</li><li>On success, it should return the purchase amount. Otherwise, it should return -1</li>
<li>If <code>d</code> or <code>name</code> is <code>NULL</code>, it is a failure. If there is no customer whose name matches the given one, it is a failure. </li>
</ul>

<li><code>GetSumCustomerPurchase</code> calculates the sum of the numbers returned by <code>fp</code> by calling <code>fp</code> for each user item. That is, this function iterates
every user item in <code>d</code>, calls <code>fp</code> once for each user item, and returns the sum of the numbers returned by <code>fp</code>. </li>
<ul>
<li>On success, <code>GetCustomerPurchase</code> should return the sum of all numbers returned by <code>fp</code> by iterating each user item in <code>d</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>d</code> or <code>fp</code> is NULL, it should return -1.</li>
<li> Note that <code>fp</code> is provided by the caller
of <code>GetSumCustomerPurchase</code>. <code>fp</code> is a function
pointer that takes user's id, name, and purchase as parameters,
evaluates a specific condition on it, and returns a non-negative
number. For example, the following code snippet shows the example of
the function pointed by <code>fp</code>, which returns the half of the
purchase amount of the user whose name contains with "Gorilla".</li>

<pre style="margin-left:2em; color: blue;">int GetHalfAmountOfUserWhoseNameContainsGorilla(const char *id, const char *name, const int purchase) {<br>
   if (strstr(name, "Gorilla") != NULL)
       return (purchase/2);
   return 0;
}
...

// call of GetSumCustomerPurchase() with the above function
int value = GetSumCustomerPurchase(d, GetHalfAmountOfUserWhoseNameContainsGorilla);  
printf("Half the purchase amount of the users whose name contains Gorilla is %d\n", value);
</pre>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>[Task 1] The <code>customer_manager</code> Array Implementation</h3>

<p>The goal of the first task is to implement
the <core>customer_manager API using a dynamically resizable
array. Array is the simplest data structure that works well for a
small number of user items.

</core></p><p>Your first <code>customer_manager</code> implementation should be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Follow the function prototype described in <a href="skeleton/customer_manager.h"><code>customer_manager.h</code></a>.</li>

<li>Write your code in a file named <code>customer_manager1.c</code> (<a href="skeleton/customer_manager1.c"><code>skeleton code</code></a>).</li>

<!--li>Use the <code>Array_T</code> data structure to manage the customer information.</li-->

<li>Avoid any memory leaks. Your <code>customer_manager</code>
implementation should use a dynamically-allocated memory (i.e.,
in <code>CreateCustomerDB()</code>
and <code>DestroyCustomerDB()</code>). It should make sure to free all
dynamically-allocated memory when the memory is no longer needed.</li>

<li> Whenever is possible, validate function parameters by calling
the <code>assert</code> macro. Determining which invariant should be
maintained is a part of your task. </li>

</ul>

Implementation tips:

<ul> 
<li> Define the structure for a user item, and allocate an array of
the user item structure when <code>CreateCustomerDB</code> is
called. You may start with the initial array size as 1024. </li>

<li> A reasonable user item structure, a DB structure,
and <code>CreteCustomerDB</code> is as follows. You can use the
following code or define your own structure differently.

<pre>#define UNIT_ARRAY_SIZE 1024

struct UserInfo {
  char *name;     // user name 
  char *id;       // user ID
  int purchase;   // purchase amount
};

struct DB {
  struct UserInfo *pArray;   // pointer to the array
  int curArrSize;            // current array size (max # of elements)
  int numItems;              // # of stored items,
                             // needed to determine when the array should be expanded

  // add more records below if needed
  ...
};

...
DB_T CreateCustomerDB(void)
{
  DB_T d;
  
  d = (DB_T) calloc(1, sizeof(struct DB));
  if (d == NULL) {
     fprintf(stderr, "Can't allocate a memory for DB_T\n");
     return NULL;
  }
  d-&gt;curArrSize = UNIT_ARRAY_SIZE; // start with 1024 elements
  d-&gt;pArray = (struct UserInfo *)calloc(d-&gt;curArrSize, sizeof(struct UserInfo));
  if (d-&gt;pArray == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Can't allocate a memory for array of size %d\n", d-&gt;curArrSize);   
    free(d);
    return NULL;
  }
  return d;
}
</pre>

</li><li> Using <code>calloc()</code> to allocate the array is often helpful
since it initializes all elements (and their fields)
to <code>0</code>.

</li><li> For <code>RegisterCustomer</code>, find an empty element in the
array, and store the new user data in it. Make sure that you copy id
and name strings instead of only their pointers.  If there is no empty
element, expand the array by calling <code>realloc()</code>. The
increment amount should be 1024 elements each time you expand.
</li>

<li> In <code>UnregisterCustomerByID</code>
or <code>UnregisterCustomerByName</code>, you search for the matching
item, and deallocate the name and id. Optionally, you can set the name
to <code>NULL</code>.  This way, you can easily know which element is
empty by checking each element's <code>name</code>
with <code>NULL</code>. </li>

<li> For <code>GetSumCustomerPurchase</code>, scan the array from
index 0 till the max index, and call <code>fp</code> for each _valid_
element. </li>

<li> Feel free to deviate from the above implementation tips if you
have your own idea to make the code run faster or more
efficiently </li>

</ul>

<!--p>Before you start this task, please go through the array implementation code and understand how it works. If you understand how the code implements dynamic memory allocation (using <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>), it would be helpful for Task 3. </p-->

<hr>
<h3>[Task 2] The <code>customer_manager</code> Hash Table Implementation</h3>

<p> Unfortunately, using an array is slow when you deal with a large
number of user items. Frequent reqistration and unregisteration of a
user item creates many holes (empty elements) scattered across the
array, which, in turn, makes these operations slow. Adding, deleting,
and searching of a user item would eventually depend on linear search
(unless you take extra measures to manage the holes separately). </p>

<p>
We improve the performance of <code>customer_manager</code> operations
with a hash table in this task. Actually, you would need two hash
tables. One is for looking up a user item with ID as a key, and the
other is for a lookup with a name as a key. </p>


<p></p>

<p>
Your hash table-based <code>customer_manager</code> implementation
should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Follow the function prototype described in <code>customer_manager.h</code>.</li>
<li>Reside in a file named <code>customer_manager2.c</code>.</li>
<li>Avoid any memory leaks. For each call of <code>malloc</code>
or <code>calloc</code> in any object, eventually there should be
exactly one call of <code>free</code>.</li>
<li>Use a reasonable hash function. You are welcome to use this one. Feel
free to modify it or define your own hash function if you'd like.</li>
</ul>

<pre style="margin-left:4em; color:blue">enum {HASH_MULTIPLIER = 65599};
...
static int hash_function(const char *pcKey, int iBucketCount)

/* Return a hash code for pcKey that is between 0 and iBucketCount-1,
   inclusive. Adapted from the EE209 lecture notes. */
{
   int i;
   unsigned int uiHash = 0U;
   for (i = 0; pcKey[i] != '\0'; i++)
      uiHash = uiHash * (unsigned int)HASH_MULTIPLIER
               + (unsigned int)pcKey[i];
   return (int)(uiHash % (unsigned int)iBucketCount);
}
</pre>


Implementation tips:

<ul>
<li> Reuse the user item data structure that you defined in task 1,
but add proper fields to keep track of the next node in a hash
table. You would need two such pointers in the new user item data
structure since you will need to maintain two hash tables. </li>

<li> Unlike the array-based implementation, each new registration
would require memory allocation of a user item structure. Please
review the code in Lecture 10 since your implementation could be
similar to it except that you need to maintain two hash tables here.
</li>

<li> Avoid gross inefficiencies. In particular, it would be grossly
inefficient to hash the given key multiple times when a single time
would suffice.</li>

<li> Start the hash table bucket size as 1024 entries. </li>

<li> (<b>Extra credit: 15%</b>) Implement hash table expansion. When
the number of nodes (user items) in a hash table reaches 75% of the
number of buckets, expand the hash table to double the number of
buckets. That is, your initial number of buckets is 1024. When the
number of nodes reaches (0.75 * 1024), you expand the number of
buckets to 2048. Again, when the number of nodes reaches (0.75 *
2048), the next number of buckets should be 4086. The max number of
buckets is 1 million (1,048,576 = 2^20), so even if the number of nodes exceeds
1 million, don't expand the hash table. Note that even after hash
table expansion, you should be able to retrieve all existing user
items already registered before hash table expansion. Mark if you
implement hash table expansion in your <code>readme</code> file.
</li>




</ul>

The following figure represents an example hash table-based
<code>customer_manager</code> implementation
(it uses the <code>hash_function</code> mentioned above).
<ul>
<li><code>hash_function("ygmoon", n)</code> and <code>hash_function
("ch.hwang128", n)</code> are 0.</li>
<li><code>hash_function("baesangwook89", n)</code> is 4.</li>
<li><code>hash_function("Changho Hwang", n)</code> and <code>hash_function
("Sangwook Bae", n)</code> are 3.</li>
<li><code>hash_function("YoungGyoun Moon", n)</code> is 5.</li>
</ul>

<h3>[Task 3] Testing Your Library and Measuring the Performance</h3>

<p>
We
provide <a href="skeleton/testclient.c"><code>testclient.c</code></a>
to test your implementations. It first checks the correctness of your
library functions and measures the performance over various user
items.  Note that we may use other programs for grading.
</p>

<p>
To compile your code, do the following:
</p><pre>
// test your array-based implementation
$ gcc209 -o testclient1 testclient.c customer_manager1.c
$ ./testclient1

// test your hash table-based implementation
$ gcc209 -o testclient2 testclient.c customer_manager2.c
$ ./testclient2

</pre>

<p>
(<b>Extra credit: 15% </b>) We will give an extra credit to the
student whose implementation is the fastest among all students.  We
may use our own program to measure the performance.

<!--
<p>In Assignment 1, you implemented a command-line interface which
performs the argument validation. After finishing
the <code>customer_manager</code> API implementation, you can put it
together with the "Customer Management Program CLI" that is
implemented in Assignment 1. In this assignment, we recommend you to
modify your <code>client.c</code> from Assignment 1 to interpret the
user command input and perform the actions (register a user, find for
a user, etc..).</p>

<ul>
<li>In Assignment 1, you were not requested to store any argument. To pass the command-line arguments to the <code>customer_manager</code> API functions, you should modify your <code>client.c</code> to store the parsed options when validating them.</li>
<li>In Assignment 1, <code>client.c</code> does not perform any action after validating the command-line arguments (may specified as "This will be expanded in assignment 3" in the code). In this assignment, you should develop this part to handle the user commands by using the <code>customer_manager</code> API.</li>
<li>Your <code>client.c</code> program will eventually handle all the following commands:
<pre style="margin-left:4em; color:blue">
Available commands are:
  exit                                       Exit program
  reg    -i ID -n NAME -p PURCHASE           Register a customer to database
  unreg  [-n NAME | -i ID]                   Unregister a customer from database
  find   [-n NAME | -i ID]                   Search for a customer from database and print the purchase amount of the customer
  sum    [-n NAME_KEYWORD | -i ID_KEYWORD]   Calculate the sum of purchase amount of the customers whose name or ID contains the keyword

</pre>
</li>

<li>Each command should following format to print customer information or error message.
<ul>
<li>If you choose to extend <code>client.c</code> from Assignment 1, it should handle all the argument format validation described in Assignment 1.</li>
<li>For <code>reg</code> command, the program does not print any message on success. If there exists an already registered customer with the same name or ID, the program should print out an error message <code>"ERROR: A customer with the same name or ID already exists"</code> to stderr. </li>
<li>For <code>unreg</code> command, the program does not print any message on success. If there is no customer whose name or ID matches the given one, the program should print out an error message <code>"ERROR: No customer found"</code> to stderr.</li>
<li>For <code>find</code> command, if the customer is found, the program should print the customer information in a format of <code>"PURCHASED: $%d"</code> to stdout. If there is no customer whose name or ID matches the given one, the program should print out an error message <code>"ERROR: No customer found"</code> to stderr.</li>
<li>For <code>sum</code> command, it finds for all the customers whose name contains <code>NAME_KEYWORD</code> or ID contains <code>ID_KEYWORD</code>, and prints the sum of the purchase amount of the customers in a format of <code>"TOTAL: $%d"</code>.
</ul>
<br>
<li>The table below shows some real examples of using the commands. In this example, we assume that the commands are entered to the program consecutively.</li>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;" border="3">

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>We will grade your work on quality from the user's point of view and from the programmer's point of view. To encourage good coding practices, we will deduct points if <code>gcc209</code> generates warning messages.</p>

<p>From the user's point of view, your module has quality if it behaves as it should.</p>

<p>In part, style is defined by the rules given in <em>The Practice of Programming</em> (Kernighan and Pike), as summarized by the <a href="../../style.pdf">Rules of Programming Style</a> document. These additional rules apply:</p>

<p><strong>Names</strong>: You should use a clear and consistent style for variable and function names. One example of such a style is to prefix each variable name with characters that indicate its type. For example, the prefix <code>c</code> might indicate that the variable is of type <code>char</code>, <code>i</code> might indicate <code>int</code>, <code>pc</code> might mean <code>char*</code>, <code>ui</code> might mean <code>unsigned int</code>, etc. But it is fine to use another style -- a style which does not include the type of a variable in its name -- as long as the result is a readable program.</p>

<p><strong>Line lengths</strong>: Limit line lengths in your source code to 72 characters. Doing so allows us to print your work in two columns, thus saving paper.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong>: Each source code file should begin with a comment that includes your name, the number of the assignment, and the name of the file.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong>: Each function should begin with a comment that describes what the function does from the caller's point of view. The function comment should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explicitly refer to the function's parameters (by name) and the function's return value.</li>

<li>State what, if anything, the function reads from standard input or any other stream, and what, if anything, the function writes to standard output, standard error, or any other stream.</li>

<li>State which global variables the function uses or affects.</li>

<li>Appear in both the interface (.h) file for the sake of the <em>clients</em> of the function and the implementation (.c) file for the sake of the <em>maintainers</em> of the function.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comments</strong>: Each structure type definition and each structure field definition should have a comment that describes it.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong>: The interface of each data structure should contain a comment that describes what an object of that type is. It would be reasonable to place that comment adjacent to the definition of the opaque pointer.</p>
