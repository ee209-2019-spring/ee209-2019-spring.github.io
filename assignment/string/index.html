<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you learn/review (1)
arrays and pointers in the C programming language, (2) how to create
and use stateless modules in C, (3) the "design by contract"
style of programming, and (4) how to use the GNU/UNIX programming
tools, especially <code>bash</code>, <code>emacs</code>, gcc,
and <code>gdb</code>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p> Implement the string functions listed by the Table
 in <a href="#part1">Part 1</a>. and <a href="#part2">Part 2</a> is the "on your own" part of this
 assignment, which is worth 50% of this assignment.
</p>

<p> You will get an <b>extra</b> 10% of the full score if you
  implement the Part 1 only with pointer notation when you access the
  character.  See the <a href="#extra">Extra credit</a> section below
  (Extra Credit for Part 1).
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>As you know, the C programming environment provides a standard
library. The facilities provided in the standard library are declared
in header files. One of those header files is string.h; it contains
the declarations of "string functions," that is, functions
that perform operations on character strings. Appendix D of the King
textbook, Appendix B3 of the Kernighan and Ritchie textbook, and the
UNIX "man" pages describe the string functions. The string
functions are used heavily in programming systems; certainly any
editor, compiler, assembler, or operating system created with the C
programming language would use them.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Overview of Your Task</h3>

<p>Your task in this assignment is to use C to create the
"Str" module that provides string manipulation
functions. Specifically, design your Str module so that
each function behaves the same as described below.
Your task in this assignment is threefold. </p>

<p><a href="#part1"><strong>[Part 1]</strong></a>

Read the description of the basic string library functions carefully,
and implement each function. The basic functions are most commonly
used standard string functions. Each function should behave the same
as its corresponding standard C function.  
</p>

<p> <a href="#part2"> <strong>[Part 2]</strong></a> 

Implement a simplified version of <code>grep</code>
using <code>Str</code> functions. Read the provided file that contains
skeleton code carefully, edit the file to make it process the required
functionalities: find, replace, diff. </p>



<hr>

<h3><a name="part1">Part 1: The Basic <code>Str</code> Function Implementation</a></h3>

<p> Your task for the first part is to use C to implement five basic
string manipulation functions: <code>StrGetLength(), StrCopy(),
StrCompare(), StrSearch(), StrConcat()</code>. Those five functions
should follow the format of the corresponding standard C library
functions. You can easily find the function's description and
operation in the UNIX "man" page. </p>

<p> The following table shows the required basic string functions in Part 1 and their corresponding function names in the standard C library.</p> 

<table style="border-collapse: collapse;" border="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th><strong><code>Str</code> Function</strong>
</th>
<th><strong>Standard C Function</strong>
</th>
<th><strong> Man page link </strong>
</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>StrGetLength</code>
</td>
<td><code>strlen</code>
</td>
<td> <a href="./file/strlen.txt"> strlen man page 
</a> 
</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>StrCopy</code>
</td>
<td><code>strcpy</code>
</td>
<td> <a href="./file/strcpy.txt"> strcpy man page 
</a> 
</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>StrCompare</code>
</td>
<td><code>strcmp</code>
</td>
<td> <a href="./file/strcmp.txt"> strcmp man page 
</a> 
</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>StrSearch</code>
</td>
<td><code>strstr</code>
</td><td> <a href="./file/strstr.txt"> strstr man page 
</a> 
</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>StrConcat</code>
</td>
<td><code>strcat</code>
</td>
<td> <a href="./file/strcat.txt"> strcat man page 
</a> 
</td> 
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>  

<p>Use the <code>Str</code> module's <em>interface</em> in a file named <a href="./src/str.h"><code>str.h</code></a>, and place your <code>Str</code> function definitions
in <a href="./src/str.c"><code>str.c</code></a>. </p>

<p>Note that your Str
functions <b>should not</b> call any of the standard string
functions. In the context of this assignment, pretend that the
standard string functions do not exist. However, your functions may
call each other, and you may define additional (non-interface)
functions.</p>

<p>Design each function definition so it calls the <code>assert</code>
macro to validate the function's parameters. In that way,
your <code>Str</code> functions should differ from the standard C
string functions. Specifically, design each function definition to
assert that each parameter is not <code>NULL</code>. See the
<a href="#assert">note</a> below for more information of
the <code>assert()</code> macro function.</p>


<p>Beware of type mismatches. In particular, beware of the difference
between type size_t and type int: a variable of type size_t can store
larger integers than a variable of type int can. Your functions should
(in principle) be able to handle strings whose lengths exceed the
capacity of type int. Also beware of type mismatches related to the
use of the const keyword.
</p>


<hr>

<h3><a name="extra"> Extra Credit for Part 1: Implement functions with pointer notation </a> </h3>

<p>There are various ways to implement the functions in Part
1. Especially, you can access the character by pointer dereferencing
like <code> *pcSrc </code> or by using an array notation such
as <code> pcSrc[uiLength] </code>. </p>

<p>Here are two examples of <code>StrGetLength() </code>
implementation.  The first code implements the StrGetLength() function
with the array notation; it traverses each given string or accesses
the character using an index relative to the beginning of the string.
However, with the pointer notation, the second version traverses each
given string using an incremented pointer.

</p><blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<pre>size_t StrGetLength(const char pcSrc[]) /* Use array notation */
{
   size_t uiLength = 0U;
   assert(pcSrc != NULL);
   while (pcSrc[uiLength] != '\0')
      uiLength++;
   return uiLength;
}
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<pre>size_t StrGetLength(const char *pcSrc) /* Use pointer notation */
{
   const char *pcEnd;
   assert(pcSrc != NULL);
   pcEnd = pcSrc;
   while (*pcEnd != '\0') /* note that *(pcSrc + uiLength) is valid but is "NOT" acceptable as pointer notation */
      pcEnd++;
   return (size_t)(pcEnd - pcSrc);
}
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p> You can freely implement Part 1. However, <strong> if you
implement part 1 only with pointer notation, you can get extra 10% of
the full score. </strong> <b> Note: if you simply convert array
notation to pointer notation (e.g., *(p+i) instead of p[i]), that does
not count as pointer notation.</b> That is, pointer notation should
not deal with an index. We will strictly apply the criteria for
pointer notation, so please avoid using notation like (p+i) to get the
full credit. p++/-- and *p are just fine.  Please write your choice of
implementation in the <code>readme</code> file. That is, specify if
you used only the pointer notation for Part 1 in
the <code>readme</code> file.
</p>


<hr>
<h3> Test your Str Functions </h3>

<p> We provide a test client
(<a href="./src/client.c"><code>client.c</code></a>) that compares
the results of the <code>Str</code> and C standard library functions
with various input. Please use this code for testing and
debugging. You can compile the test client with <code>gcc209</code> as
follows.

</p><blockquote>
<pre>gcc209 -o client client.c str.c
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p></p>
Then, test each of your <code>Str</code> functions separately by providing
a function name as an argument. For example,

<blockquote>
<pre>./client StrCopy
</pre>
</blockquote>

will test <code>StrCopy</code>. Actually, the client accepts any one of the <code>Str</code> function names as a command-line argument: <p></p>

<blockquote>
<pre>./client [StrGetLength|StrCopy|StrCompare|StrSearch|StrConcat]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Note that passing all tests provided by the client does <b>not</b>
mean that your function always behaves correctly. Please devise your
own testing (e.g., by changing the client code) for more confidence.
Note that we may use a different test client for grading.  


</p><hr>
<h3><a name="part2"> Part 2: Simple Grep</a> </h3>

<p> <code>grep</code> is a popular UNIX tool that manipulates input strings. In this part, you implement a simplified version of <code>grep</code> called <code>sgrep</code>. <code>sgrep</code> provides these three functionalities. 

</p><ul>
<li><strong>Find (<code>-f search-string</code>)</strong>: reads each line from standard input (<code>stdin</code>) and prints out <b>only the lines </b>that contain <code>search-string</code> to standard output (<code>stdout</code>). </li>
<!--li><strong>Count (<code>-c search-string file1</code>)</strong>: reads each line from file (file1) and prints out only <b>the number of lines </b>that contain <code>search-string</code> to standard output (<code>stdout</code>). Multiple occurrences of the searched-string in the same line is still counted once. </li-->
<li><strong>Replace (<code>-r string1 string2</code>)</strong>: reads each line from standard input (<code>stdin</code>), <b>replaces all occurrences</b> of <code>string1</code> with <code>string2</code>, and prints it out to standard output (<code>stdout</code>). If <code>string1</code> is not found in the line, the original line is copied to <code>stdout</code>. </li>
<li><strong>Diff (<code>-d file1 file2</code>)</strong>: compares the two files (file1 and file2) line by line, and prints out <b>only the different lines </b>with their line numbers to standard output (<code>stdout</code>). The output format of the different line should be as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>file1@line-num:file1's line
file2@line-num:file2's line
<pre></pre></pre></blockquote>
<!--li><strong>FrequentWord (<code>-w file1</code>)</strong>: read the file (<code>file1</code>), and prints out the word that <b>most frequently appeared</b> in the file (<code>file1</code>) with the word count to standard output (<code>stdout</code>). If there are muliple words that appeared the same times in the file, print out the all words. The output format should be as follows: (word1 and word2 appear the same times)
<blockquote>
<pre>
word1@word1's count
word2@word2's count
<pre>
</blockquote!-->

</li>
</ul>

<p> Here are some usage examples of <code>sgrep</code> (you can also see the test files (<a href="./etc/google.txt"><code>google_wiki.txt</code></a> and <a href="./etc/microsoft.txt"><code>microsoft.txt</code></a>) which are used in the following example): </p>

<p>
<b>Rules:</b>

</p><ul>
<li> <b>General rules</b> </li>
<ul>
<li> Use your Str functions to implement the functionality. That is, you need to finish Part 1 first to get any credit for this task. You should not use any string function in string.h </li>
<li> Assume each line (including a new line character ('\n') is no more than 1023 bytes. You should stop your program with a proper error message if you encounter a line larger than 1023 bytes.</li>
<li> A string argument (<code>search-string, string1, string2</code>) refers to a sequence of any non-space characters. It can be enclosed with double quote(") characters and can be either empty ("") or can include a space (e.g., "hello world"). No need to handle an escape character for this assignment. </li>
<li> Assume a string or a file argument is no more than 1023 bytes. You should stop your program with a proper error message if you encounter a command-line argument that's too long.
</li><li> Any error message should be printed out to standard error (<code>stderr</code>). Use <code>fprintf(stderr, ...);</code> for that.</li> 
<li> Unlike Part 1, you don't have to add assert function while implementing sgrep. In other words, after printing out the error messages in error case, sgrep should be finished with EXIT_FAILURE as the return value. Details are written in skeleton code, so please read the comments in skeletion code (<code><a href="./src/sgrep.c">sgrep.c</a></code>). </li> 
</ul>
<li> <b>Rules for Find and Replace</b> </li>
<ul>
<li> <code>string1</code> cannot be an empty string. In such a case, your program should stop with a proper error message (e.g., "Error: Can't replace an empty substring"). </li>
<li> Other string arguments (<code>string2, search-string</code>) <strong>can</strong> be an empty string. That is, an empty search string matches any line, and if <code>string2</code> is an empty string, it removes any occurrences of <code>string1</code> in the matching line.
</li><li> <b>New:</b> Do not use dynamic memory allocation (malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), alloca(), etc.) nor a large local array. Note that it suffices to delcare a char buffer whose size is 1024 bytes (or 1025 bytes as shown in sgrep.c) even for string replacement. Any char buffer larger than 1025 bytes is considered too large for the assignment.
</li></ul>
<!--li> <b> Rules for FrequentWord </b> </li>
<ul>
<li> The length of the words in <code>file</code> used in 'frequentword (-w)' option is no more than 1023 bytes, and the number of words is also no more than 5000. You should stop your program with a proper error message if you encounter a word that's too long or the total number of words exceeds 5000. (Error messages are written in skeleton code)</li> 
<li> Note that a word cannot include the space(" ") or newline(\n). (e.g., a sentence "In 2004, Google's Google Inc." consists of five words: "In", "2004,", "Google's", "Google", "Inc.")  
<li> The two words are regarded as the same words only if they are exactly matched. (e.g., "Google" and "google" are the different words (case-sensitive). "Google's" and "Google" are the different words (ignore substring)). </li>
<li> When you print out the multiple words, you don't need to consider the order of printing word. </li>
</ul!-->

</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Tips:</b>

</p><ul>
<li> We provide a skeleton code file (<code><a href="./src/sgrep.c">sgrep.c</a></code>). You can start with the file. </li>
<li> <code>fgets</code> should be useful for reading a line from a file. 'man fgets' should give you more information. </li>
</ul>
  
<hr>
<h3>Logistics</h3>

<p>Develop on lab machines using <code>emacs</code> to create source code and <code>gdb</code> to debug.</p>

<p> For part 1, you implement the code <code>str.c</code> and <code>str.h</code>, which should contain the definitions of required functions. 

</p><p> For part 2, a skeleton C file is available here: <a href="./src/sgrep.c">sgrep.c</a>. It implements the basic I/O and argument parsing, so all you need is fill out the rest of the functionalities with <code>Str</code> functions. Feel free to use this file as your starting point (of course, you don't have to use it), and change any part in the code if you'd like. </p>

<p>Create a <code>readme</code> text file that contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name and your student ID</li>

<li>A description of whatever help (if any) you received from others while doing the assignment, and the names of any individuals with whom you collaborated, as prescribed by the course "Policy" web page.</li>

<li><em>Is it possible for <code>StrCopy</code> to call <code>assert</code> to verify that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough? Explain.</em></li>

<li>(Optionally) Please write the your implementation method in <code>readme</code> text file whether you use pointer notation for the extra credit. </li>

<li>(Optionally) An indication of how much time you spent doing the assignment.</li>

<li>(Optionally) Your assessment of the assignment.</li>

<li>(Optionally) Any information that will help us to grade your work in the most favorable light. In particular you should describe all known bugs.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Submission</h3>

<p>
Use <a href="http://klms.kaist.ac.kr">KAIST
KLMS</a> to submit your assignments. Your submission should
be one gzipped tar file whose name is 

</p><p>
YourStudentID_assign2.tar.gz 

</p><p>
For example, if your student ID is 20161234,
please name the file as

</p><p>
20161234_assign2.tar.gz 

</p><p>the single tar file which includes
following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Task 1) <code>str.c</code> and <code>str.h</code> files</li>
<li>(Task 2) updated <code>sgrep.c</code> file</li>
<li><code>readme</code> text file</li>
<li> <a href="../EthicsOath.docx">Observance of Ethics</a>. Sign on the document, save it into a PDF file, and submit it. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>We will grade your work on quality from the user's point of view and from the programmer's point of view. To encourage good coding practices, we will deduct points if <code>gcc209</code> generates warning messages.</p>

<p>From the user's point of view, your module has quality if it behaves as it should.</p>

<p>In part, style is defined by the rules given in <em>The Practice of Programming</em> (Kernighan and Pike), as summarized by the <a href="../../style.pdf">Rules of Programming Style</a> document. These additional rules apply:</p>

<p><strong>Names</strong>: You should use a clear and consistent style for variable and function names. One example of such a style is to prefix each variable name with characters that indicate its type. For example, the prefix <code>c</code> might indicate that the variable is of type <code>char</code>, <code>i</code> might indicate <code>int</code>, <code>pc</code> might mean <code>char*</code>, <code>ui</code> might mean <code>unsigned int</code>, etc. But it is fine to use another style -- a style which does not include the type of a variable in its name -- as long as the result is a readable program.</p>

<p><strong>Line lengths</strong>: Limit line lengths in your source code to 72 characters. Doing so allows us to print your work in two columns, thus saving paper.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong>: Each source code file should begin with a comment that includes your name, the number of the assignment, and the name of the file.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong>: Each function should begin with a comment that describes what the function does from the caller's point of view. The function comment should:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Explicitly refer to the function's parameters (by name) and the function's return value.</li>
<li>State what, if anything, the function reads from standard input or any other stream, and what, if anything, the function writes to standard output, standard error, or any other stream.</li>

<li>State which global variables the function uses or affects.</li>

<li>Appear in both the interface (.h) file for the sake of the <em>clients</em> of the function and the implementation (.c) file for the sake of the <em>maintainers</em> of the function.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parameter Validation</strong>: Validate function parameters via asserts whenever possible.</p>

<hr>
<!-- =============================================================== -->

<h3><a name="assert">Note: assert and NDEBUG</a></h3>

<p> assert is a macro implementations of assertion, used for verifying the conditions. If the condition is true, it does nothing. However, if the conditions is FALSE, it displays an error messages and aborts the running program. </p>

<p> In this assignment, you should validate the function's parameters with <code>assert</code>. When you try to check whether your <code>Str</code> functions validate the given parameters correctly or not, the aborted program may annoy you. In that case, you can add <code>NDEBUG</code> macro in your source file to ignore the assert functions. Otherwise, you can also add -D NDEBUG argument to the <code>gcc</code>. The <code>-D NDEBUG</code> argument commands <code>gcc209</code> to define the <code>NDEBUG</code> macro, just as if the preprocessor directive <code>#define NDEBUG</code> appeared in the specified .c file(s). Following OBcommands are example of disabling assert using -D option</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>gcc209 -D NDEBUG sgrep.c str.c -o sgrep
</pre></blockquote>

<p> If NDEBUG is defined as a macro name in the source file, the assert macro is defined as <code>((void)0)</code>, which means that the assert macro will be ignore.
</p>

<hr>
<!-- =============================================================== -->

<h3>Note: Using Idioms</h3>

<p>C programmers sometimes use idioms that rely on the fact that the null character ('\0'), the <code>NULL</code> address, the integer 0, and the logical concept FALSE have the same representation. You may use those idioms. For example, you may define <code>StrGetLength</code> like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<pre>size_t StrGetLength(const char pcSrc[])
{
   size_t uiLength = 0U;
   assert(pcSrc); /* NULL address, 0, and FALSE are identical. */
   while (pcSrc[uiLength]) /* null character and FALSE are identical. */
      uiLength++;
   return uiLength;
}
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>or like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<pre>size_t StrGetLength(const char *pcSrc)
{
   const char *pcEnd;
   assert(pcSrc); /* NULL address, 0, and FALSE are identical. */
   pcEnd = pcSrc;
   while (*pcEnd) /* null character and FALSE are identical. */
      pcEnd++;
   return (size_t)(pcEnd - pcSrc);
}
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>But you are not required to use those idioms. In fact, we recommend that you avoid the use of idioms that adversely affect understandability.</p>

<hr>
<!-- =============================================================== -->

<h3>Note: The <code>const</code> Keyword and <code>StrSearch</code></h3>

<p>The use of the <code>const</code> keyword within <code>StrSearch</code> is tricky, as this question-and-answer sequence indicates.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>

<p>According to the man pages, the parameters of <code>strstr</code> are of type <code>const char*</code>. That implies that the parameters of <code>StrSearch</code> also should be of type <code>const char*</code>. Why are they not of type <code>char*</code>?</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>

<p>Suppose you were to define <code>StrSearch</code> like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<pre>char *StrSearch(char *pcHaystack, char *pcNeedle)
{
   ...
}
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>Further suppose the client then calls <code>StrSearch</code> like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<pre>const char *pcBig = "hello";
const char *pcSmall = "lo";
 ...
 ... StrSearch(pcBig, pcSmall) ...
 ...
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note that's a perfectly reasonable way to call the function.) In that case the compiler, noting that <code>pcBig</code> is of type <code>const char*</code> and that <code>pcHaystack</code> is of type <code>char*</code>, would generate a warning on the function call. Thus <code>pcHaystack</code> (and <code>pcNeedle</code>) should be of type <code>const char*</code>.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>

<p>According to the man pages, the return type of <code>strstr</code> is <code>char*</code>. That implies that the return type of <code>StrSearch</code> also should be of type <code>char*</code>. Why is the return type not <code>const char*</code>?</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>

<p>Suppose you were to define <code>StrSearch</code> like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<pre>const char *StrSearch(const char *pcHaystack, const char *pcNeedle)
{
   ...
}
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>Further suppose the client then calls <code>StrSearch</code> like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<pre>char *pcBig = "hello";
char *pcSmall = "lo";
char *pc;
 ...
pc = StrSearch(pcBig, pcSmall);
 ...
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note that's a perfectly reasonable way to call the function.) In that case the compiler, noting that <code>pc</code> is of type <code>char*</code> and that the value returned by <code>StrSearch</code> is of type <code>const char*</code>, would generate a warning on the assignment statement. Thus the return type of <code>StrSearch</code> should be <code>char*</code> and should not be <code>const char*</code>.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>

<p>Within the definition of <code>StrSearch</code>, I decided to define a local variable named <code>pc</code> that "points into" the first of the two given strings, as indicated by this code:</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<pre>char *StrSearch(const char *pcHaystack, const char *pcNeedle)
{
   ...
   pc = pcHaystack;
   ...
   /* Increment pc so it points to the appropriate character. */
   ...
   return pc;
}
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>If I define <code>pc</code> to be of type <code>char*</code>, then the assignment statement generates a warning. If I define <code>pc</code> to be of type <code>const char*</code>, then the <code>return</code> statement generates a warning. How can I resolve that problem?</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, C provides no elegant solution. We recommend that you define <code>pc</code> to be of type <code>const char*</code> so the assignment statement is warningless. Then use a cast operator in the <code>return</code> statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<pre>return (char*)pc;
</pre>
