NAME
       strcat, strncat - concatenate two strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strcat(char *dest, const char *src);

       char *strncat(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strcat()  function  appends  the src string to the dest string, overwriting the
       terminating null byte ('\0') at the end of dest, and then adds  a  terminating  null
       byte.   The  strings may not overlap, and the dest string must have enough space for
       the result.

       The strncat() function is similar, except that

       *  it will use at most n characters from src; and

       *  src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more characters.

       As with strcat(), the resulting string in dest is always null-terminated.

       If src contains n or more characters, strncat() writes n+1  characters  to  dest  (n
       from  src  plus  the terminating null byte).  Therefore, the size of dest must be at
       least strlen(dest)+n+1.


RETURN VALUE
       The strcat() and strncat() functions return a pointer to the resulting string dest.
